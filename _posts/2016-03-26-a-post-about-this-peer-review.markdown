This is just a test post as I work through the tutorial, which has gone really well so far.

The only brief problem I had was when I was first customizing my Jekyll homepage, and somehow
or other I managed to break the page, so I couldn't turn it on again, and because I'd been foolhardy
and hadn't added things one at a time, tracking the bug wasn't easy. What **is** easy, however,
is Ctrl-Z. *Ctrl-Z* is your friend.

And once I'd worked through that, it was fine.

I have to say, I've never quite seen the point of Markdown -- _well_, let me put that differently: 
I've never actually **needed** Markdown, and not needing it, I didn't learn it. That said, it's 
very similar to the stylistic conventions of mid-90s Usenet groups, so maybe it'll come more
naturally to me than I think.

I just want to test the list functionality:

* Tonight is Erev Half-Priced Chocolate Day
+ Tomorrow is Easter
- The Day after that is Ann Leckie's 2SID
* Yeah, that should be a good test.
